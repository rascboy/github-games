## How to play

- As the blocks fall, rotate them to fit them on a line
- The object of the game is to clear full lines of blocks
- Use the left and right arrow keys to rotate the block left and right and use the down arrow key to bring them down faster
- The more lines you clear at the same time, the more points you get
